## About Me

Hello! I'm Rupam Biswas, a passionate developer with a strong interest in coding and technology. My journey began with a curiosity for problem-solving and a desire to create innovative applications that make a difference. Over the past few years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, with a particular focus on Python, web development, and automation.

I believe in the power of continuous learning and enjoy exploring new technologies, frameworks, and coding challenges. My goal is to not only improve my technical abilities but also to share my knowledge with others and contribute to open-source projects.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, participating in coding communities, or working on personal projects. I'm excited to document my progress through the 100 Days of Code challenge and look forward to the journey ahead!

## Goals

- Enhance my coding skills in Python and other programming languages.
- Complete various projects and share them on GitHub.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Build a strong foundation in software development principles.

## Projects

### Day 1: Birthday Wish Automation
- Created an automation script in Python to send birthday wishes to friends and family. Used date comparison and email automation to streamline the process of sending personalized birthday messages.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/Birthday-wish-automation-python)

  
### Day 2: Longest Common Prefix
- Implemented an algorithm in Python to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings. The solution focused on minimizing comparisons and efficiently handling edge cases.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day2)

### Day 3: Functions, Life in Weeks Calculator, and Caesar Cipher
- Completed learning about functions in Python, including defining and calling functions, parameter handling, and return values.
- Built a **Life in Weeks Calculator** that calculates how many weeks, months, and days you have left to live based on your current age (assuming a lifespan of 90 years).
- Created a **Caesar Cipher** project to encrypt and decrypt messages using basic shift-based encryption.

### Day 4: Dictionaries, Grading Program, and Auction System
- Learned about dictionaries in Python, including how to create, access, and manipulate key-value pairs.
- Developed a **Grading Program** that takes student names and scores as input and outputs their corresponding grades based on predefined criteria.
- Created an **Auction System** where users can place bids on items, track the highest bid, and determine the auction winner.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day4)

### Day 5: Number Guessing Game
- Built a **Number Guessing Game** in Python, where the program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, and keeps track of the number of attempts taken.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day5)

### Day 6: Quiz Game
- Built a quiz game using object-oriented programming in Python! Created classes for questions/logic and used a loop to control the quiz flow. 
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day6)
