## About Me

Hello! I'm Rupam Biswas, a passionate developer with a strong interest in coding and technology. My journey began with a curiosity for problem-solving and a desire to create innovative applications that make a difference. Over the past few years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, with a particular focus on Python, web development, and automation.

I believe in the power of continuous learning and enjoy exploring new technologies, frameworks, and coding challenges. My goal is to not only improve my technical abilities but also to share my knowledge with others and contribute to open-source projects.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, participating in coding communities, or working on personal projects. I'm excited to document my progress through the 100 Days of Code challenge and look forward to the journey ahead!

## Goals

- Enhance my coding skills in Python and other programming languages.
- Complete various projects and share them on GitHub.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Build a strong foundation in software development principles.

## Projects

### Day 1: Birthday Wish Automation
- Created an automation script in Python to send birthday wishes to friends and family. Used date comparison and email automation to streamline the process of sending personalized birthday messages.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/Birthday-wish-automation-python)

### Day 2: Longest Common Prefix
- Implemented an algorithm in Python to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings. The solution focused on minimizing comparisons and efficiently handling edge cases.

### Day 3: Functions, Life in Weeks Calculator, and Caesar Cipher
- Completed learning about functions in Python, including defining and calling functions, parameter handling, and return values.
- Built a **Life in Weeks Calculator** that calculates how many weeks, months, and days you have left to live based on your current age (assuming a lifespan of 90 years).
- Created a **Caesar Cipher** project to encrypt and decrypt messages using basic shift-based encryption.

### Day 4: Dictionaries, Grading Program, and Auction System
- Learned about dictionaries in Python, including how to create, access, and manipulate key-value pairs.
- Developed a **Grading Program** that takes student names and scores as input and outputs their corresponding grades based on predefined criteria.
- Created an **Auction System** where users can place bids on items, track the highest bid, and determine the auction winner.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day4)

### Day 5: Number Guessing Game
- Built a **Number Guessing Game** in Python, where the program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, and keeps track of the number of attempts taken.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day5)

### Day 6: Quiz Game
- Built a quiz game using object-oriented programming in Python! Created classes for questions/logic and used a loop to control the quiz flow. 
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day6)

### Day 7: Inheritance and Employee Management System
- Explored the concept of inheritance in Python. Created an **Employee Management System** that uses classes to manage employee records.
- Implemented base classes for general employee attributes and derived classes for specific employee roles (e.g., Manager, Developer).
- This project demonstrates how to leverage inheritance to create a scalable and organized code structure.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day7)

### Day 8: File Handling, Paths, and Personalized Letters
- Learned about **file handling** in Python and practiced working with **relative** and **absolute paths**.
- Created a script that reads names from a file and personalizes a template letter for each name.
- This project enhanced my understanding of reading and writing files, as well as string manipulation.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day8)

### Day 9: Abstraction with Payment System
- Explored the concept of abstraction in Python using the `abc` module. 
- Implemented a **Payment System** that supports different payment methods using an abstract base class and concrete subclasses. This project demonstrates how abstraction can be used to enforce common behaviors while allowing flexibility for different payment methods.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day9)

### Day 10: Polymorphism in Python with Animal Example
- Explored Polymorphism in Python through method overriding.
- Created a project where different animal classes (Dog, Cat) inherit from a base class Animal, each with its own specific implementation of the sound() method.
- This showcases the flexibility of polymorphism, allowing a single function to handle different object types dynamically.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day10)

### Day 11: Mastering List Comprehension in Python
- Focused on list comprehension to simplify code and enhance readability.
- Tackled a data overlap problem—finding common numbers between two files.
- This practice improved my skills in efficient data handling and streamlined my coding process.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day11)

### Day 12: Weather Conversion with Dictionary Comprehension
- Explored dictionary comprehension in Python to convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit.
- Created a dictionary representing the weather for each day of the week and applied the conversion formula.
- This practice enhanced my understanding of efficient data manipulation and improved my coding efficiency.
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day12)

### Day 13 – Exception Handling in Python
Today, I focused on mastering some key concepts in exception handling:
- **`try-except`** blocks to catch and handle errors
- Using **`else`** for code execution when no exceptions occur
- **`finally`** to ensure clean-up after try-except blocks
- Raising custom exceptions using **raise** keyword for specific error handling
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day13)

### Day 14 – Automating Rain Alerts
Today, I focused on enhancing my Rain Alert System using the following concepts:
- Utilizing the `requests` module to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API
- Implementing the `dotenv` module to securely manage API keys and credentials
- Automating SMS notifications via **Twilio** when rain is expected

### Day 17 – Array Rotation and Reversal
Today, I practiced array manipulation techniques by focusing on:
- Rotating arrays using both left and right rotation methods
- Reversing arrays in-place without using additional space
- Optimized solutions for handling large datasets efficiently
- These exercises helped deepen my understanding of array data structures and improved my problem-solving speed.

### Day 18 – Linear and Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)
Today, I focused on mastering search algorithms:
- Implemented **Linear Search** to find elements sequentially
- Practiced both iterative and recursive approaches for **Binary Search** to efficiently locate elements in a sorted array
- Compared the time complexity of both algorithms, with Binary Search providing significant improvements over larger datasets
- Check it out on GitHub: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/iamrupambiswas/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day18)

### Day 19 – Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
Today, I focused on exploring fundamental sorting algorithms:
- Implemented **Bubble Sort**, which repeatedly swapped adjacent elements to sort the array
- Practiced **Selection Sort**, where I selected the smallest element from the unsorted part and placed it at the beginning
- Worked on **Insertion Sort**, inserting elements in their correct position as I progressed through the array
- Compared the time complexities of these algorithms and analyzed their performance on small datasets
